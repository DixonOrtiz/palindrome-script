# Palindromes

## Steps to run

### Clone Repository

`git clone https://github.com/DixonOrtiz/companies-api`

### Run with node

`node palindrome.js`

### Note

- I considered strings that were at least 3 characters long
- No meaningful words or phrases were found, but when testing with other texts, yes, so it is assumed that there was no such thing in the given text
